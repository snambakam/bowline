CVE-2021-4095 - Does not apply to Mariner
Upstream: 55749769fe608fa3f4a075e42e89d237c8e37637
This patch majorly affects arch/x86/kvm/xen.c, which, looking at the Makefile (https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner-Linux-Kernel/blob/rolling-lts/mariner-2/5.15.37.1/arch/x86/kvm/Makefile#L27) it is only built if CONFIG_KVM_XEN is enabled.
We do not enable CONFIG_KVM_XEN in Mariner, and from the Kconfig description (https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner-Linux-Kernel/blob/rolling-lts/mariner-2/5.15.37.1/arch/x86/kvm/Kconfig#L116) this config enables KVM support for XEN VM guests. Xen is a hypervisor / virtualization technology stack, and we do not expect to run any Xen guest images on Mariner
